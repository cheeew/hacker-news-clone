# Hacker News Clone

Using React and Hacker News' API, I decided to create my own Hacker News Clone.

Everything here is client-side JS, so there are brief load times when requesting to HN's server. However, session storage is utilized to create a more seamless experience after the initial load of each core page (links in the top nav).

To refresh all post data you can either refresh the screen or click the "Refresh Posts" button at the top of each page.
